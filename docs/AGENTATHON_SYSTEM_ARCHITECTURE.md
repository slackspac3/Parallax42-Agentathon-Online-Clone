# Agentathon System Architecture

This document is the judge-facing architecture view for the G42 Agentathon submission. It explains how the repository satisfies the evaluator API shape while preserving the existing Parallax42 product runtime.

## 1. Architectural Position

Parallax42 has two intentionally separate execution surfaces:

| Surface | Primary files | Purpose | Current claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agentathon evaluator path | `run.py`, `app/`, `scripts/agentathon_run.js`, `metadata.json`, `input_examples/`, `output_examples/`, `logs/` | Reproducible API for technical screening on port 8000. | Submission API, multi-agent trace, deterministic final decision, Docker/CI smoke. |
| Product demo path | `server.js`, `api/`, `lib/`, `public/` | Existing Node/CommonJS Vercel/static product experience. | Browser cockpit, smart intake, evidence workflow, review pack UI, product-hosted integrations. |

The FastAPI wrapper is not a rewrite of the product. It is a screening adapter that makes the existing compliance engine and evidence workflow judgeable through a standard `/run` contract.

## 2. End-to-End Diagram

  -> server-side Compass gateway client
  -> smart intake / active-question validation
  -> evidence indexing and retrieval boundary
  -> deterministic compliance engine
  -> optional advisory council output
  -> human-review decision pack and trace
```

## 3. Runtime Boundaries

| Boundary | Env / URL | Used by | What it is | What it is not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agentathon direct Compass | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1` | `app/compass_client.py`, `/compass/probe`, `/run`, `scripts/compass_doctor.py`, optional embeddings | Official OpenAI-compatible contract for the FastAPI evaluator path. | Not the browser product gateway and not the droplet backend. |
| Product Compass gateway | `COMPASS_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `COMPASS_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Existing Node/Vercel product APIs and `lib/compassGatewayClient.js` | Server-side product model boundary for smart intake, advisory LLM, and embeddings. | Not automatically proof of the official Agentathon direct Compass endpoint unless it exposes compatible `/v1` routes and is allowed by rules. |
| Product backend / droplet | `PARALLAX42_BACKEND_URL`, optional `P42_CREWAI_SERVICE_URL` | Backend relay, parser/OCR support, optional remote product services | Product infrastructure for the richer hosted demo. | Not a Compass API and should not be used as `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. |
| Qdrant | `P42_VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant`, `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_COLLECTION` | Evidence memory and optional learning memory | Durable vector memory when configured and smoke-tested. | Not active by default and not claimed unless `qdrant_smoke.py` passes. |
| Local fallback memory | no external service required | CI, local demos, sample mode | Deterministic fallback for evidence and governed learning memory. | Not production-durable RAG. |

## 4. Agentathon `/run` Flow

`POST /run` accepts the official evaluator-style payload:

```json
{
  "run_id": "eval-001",
  "use_case_id": "21",
  "input": {
    "query": "...",
    "case": {},
    "evidence": []
  },
  "options": {
    "sample_mode": false,
    "max_iterations": 3
  }
}
```

The response includes the official fields plus backward-compatible details:

```text
run_id
status
use_case_id
output
agents
agent_trace
trace_id
log_file
execution_time_seconds
```

The orchestrator sequence is:

1. Intake Agent extracts case facts and identifies missing facts.
2. Evidence Retrieval Agent indexes/searches evidence through local fallback or Qdrant.
3. Privacy, Security, and Responsible AI specialists validate or challenge the evidence.
4. Learning & Precedent Specialist retrieves advisory similar-case patterns and controls.
5. Compass Advisory Critic attempts live advisory review when non-sample mode and credentials allow it.
6. Deterministic Decision Owner applies deterministic policy and remains final authority.
7. Audit Packager writes structured output and JSONL trace logs under `logs/`.

The trace is deliberately non-linear. It includes delegation, evidence retry or fallback, critique, validation, escalation, shared context updates, and final synthesis.

## 5. Final Decision Authority

The system separates advisory intelligence from approval authority:

| Input source | Can influence required actions? | Can directly approve/reject? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic rules engine | Yes | Yes | Final owner for decision, risk level, required actions, and human-review boundary. |
| Specialist council findings | Yes | No | Converted into controls only through deterministic policy. |
| Compass advisory | Yes, as reviewer questions or notes | No | Advisory only. Failures are structured as unavailable. |
| Governed learning memory | Yes, when current gaps support it | No | Similar cases and control suggestions are advisory only. |
| CrewAI live runtime | Yes, if enabled and successful | No | Optional path; disabled by default and not required for Docker/CI. |

The output records:

```text
decision_authority.final_owner = Deterministic Decision Owner
decision_authority.llm_advisory_only = true
human_review_required = true/false based on deterministic policy
```

## 6. Live AI And Compass Usage

There are two live-AI stories, and they should not be mixed:

1. Agentathon evaluator mode uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1`.
   - `/compass/probe` checks `/models` and `/chat/completions`.
   - `scripts/compass_doctor.py --strict` is the live proof command.
   - `REQUIRE_COMPASS=true` makes non-sample `/run` return a structured error if Compass is unavailable.

2. Product demo mode uses the Parallax42 server-side gateway.
   - The browser never receives model keys.
   - The gateway supports smart intake, advisory LLM responses, and embeddings for product workflows.
   - This keeps the product aligned with the long-term architecture while the FastAPI wrapper satisfies evaluator shape.

`SAMPLE_MODE=true` is a deterministic fallback for CI and reproducible demos. It is not a live Compass proof and does not load canned output examples.

## 7. Conversation And Clarification Loop

The product chat has an active-question contract:

```text
active question
  -> user answer
  -> field extraction
  -> answer validation
     -> relevant answer: update case and advance
     -> useful but different answer: capture context and keep the active question
     -> unrelated answer: do not pollute case state, repeat the active clarification
     -> unknown/pending: record a known gap and continue when policy allows
```

Example:

```text
Question: From which country or export-control jurisdiction will the supplier ship?
Answer: from the US
Result: exportOriginJurisdiction = US, import geography remains UAE/Singapore, next question advances.
```

This prevents unrelated responses from being treated as compliance facts and keeps the conversation adaptive while still auditable.

## 8. Evidence RAG Memory

Evidence memory supports two providers:

| Provider | When used | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qdrant` | `P42_VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant`, Qdrant env vars, and Compass embedding env are configured | Chunks evidence, embeds through Compass/OpenAI-compatible embeddings, stores `type=evidence_chunk` payloads, searches by `caseId`, returns citation-safe snippets. |
| `local-fallback` | Default when Qdrant or embeddings are unavailable | Uses lexical retrieval over synthetic/input evidence. Useful for CI and deterministic demos; not durable. |

The browser/API response does not expose raw embedding vectors. Evidence results include safe fields such as snippet, title, document ID, evidence ID, chunk index, domain, and score.

Smoke command:

```bash
python scripts/qdrant_smoke.py
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --qdrant-smoke
```

## 9. Governed Learning Memory

Learning memory is advisory precedent storage, not model training.

Supported artifact types:

```text
case_outcome
reviewer_feedback
control_pattern
decision_override
evidence_quality_note
```

Providers:

| Provider | When used | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qdrant` | Qdrant and Compass embeddings are configured | Stores/retrieves learning artifacts as advisory vector memory. |
| `local-jsonl` | Default fallback | Reads synthetic seed data from `data/sample_learning_memory.json` and optional local JSONL feedback. |

Learning memory can surface similar cases, repeated evidence gaps, and suggested controls. It cannot silently mutate policy or override the Deterministic Decision Owner.

## 10. Optional CrewAI Runtime

The stable default runtime is the custom orchestrator. Live CrewAI is optional:

```text
AGENT_RUNTIME=crewai_live
CREWAI_ENABLE_LIVE_LLM=1
```

Default Docker/CI does not require CrewAI. If live CrewAI is enabled and fails, the wrapper records advisory unavailability and continues through the deterministic path. CrewAI outputs are non-authoritative.

## 11. Security And Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Secrets | `.env` is ignored; `.env.example` contains placeholders only; preflight scans for obvious committed secrets. |
| Browser keys | Browser never receives Compass, gateway, Qdrant, or embedding provider keys. |
| Embeddings | Raw embedding vectors are not returned to browser/API callers. |
| Documents | Sample/evaluator data is synthetic. Production OCR/parser persistence is not claimed in this repo. |
| Audit | Logs are JSONL and hash/audit capable, but enterprise-durable audit storage is not claimed unless configured separately. |
| RBAC | Audit-mode identity and route policy support exist; enforced production RBAC is not claimed unless configured and verified. |
| Approval | No autonomous approval. Human review boundary remains explicit. |

## 12. File Map

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| FastAPI evaluator API | `run.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/schemas.py` |
| Agentathon orchestrator | `app/agentathon_orchestrator.py`, `app/trace_logger.py` |
| Compass diagnostics | `app/compass_client.py`, `scripts/compass_doctor.py` |
| Node bridge | `app/node_bridge.py`, `scripts/agentathon_run.js` |
| Evidence memory | `app/evidence_memory.py`, `scripts/qdrant_smoke.py`, `lib/evidenceVectorStore.js` |
| Governed learning memory | `app/learning_memory.py`, `data/sample_learning_memory.json`, `lib/learningMemory.js` |

## 13. Verification Flow

The submission is reviewed online first. Local commands are secondary reproduction tools.

Primary online checks:

| Online check | Link | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository contents | <https://github.com/slackspac3/Parallax42-Compliance-Intelligence-Agent> | Root evaluator files, examples, logs, docs, Dockerfile, and workflows are visible on `main`. |
| Product cockpit | <https://slackspac3.github.io/Parallax42-Compliance-Intelligence-Agent/> | Static cockpit loads and reaches the configured hosted product routes. |
| Agentathon Preflight | <https://github.com/slackspac3/Parallax42-Compliance-Intelligence-Agent/actions/workflows/agentathon-preflight.yml> | `agentathon-preflight` and `docker-smoke` jobs pass. |
| CI | <https://github.com/slackspac3/Parallax42-Compliance-Intelligence-Agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml> | `npm run qa` passes online. |

The online `docker-smoke` job is the primary evaluator API proof. It builds the image, runs `python run.py` inside the container, calls `GET /health`, and posts `input_examples/example_1.json` to `POST /run`.

Secondary local checks:

```bash
npm run qa
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --run-api
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --json
python -m json.tool metadata.json
```

Docker:

```bash
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --docker
```

If Docker is not installed locally, this reports `SKIPPED_DOCKER_CLI_MISSING`. GitHub Actions verifies Docker through `.github/workflows/agentathon-preflight.yml`.

Compass:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<real Compass key>
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1
export SAMPLE_MODE=false
export REQUIRE_COMPASS=true
python scripts/compass_doctor.py --strict
curl http://localhost:8000/compass/probe
```

Qdrant:

```bash
export P42_VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant
export QDRANT_URL=<qdrant-url>
export QDRANT_API_KEY=<qdrant-key>
export QDRANT_COLLECTION=p42_compliance_evidence
python scripts/qdrant_smoke.py
```

Artifact regeneration:

```bash
python scripts/regenerate_agentathon_artifacts.py
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py
```

## 14. Safe And Unsafe Claims

Safe claims when the current checks pass:

- Root `run.py` exposes the Agentathon evaluator API on port 8000.
- `/run`, `/health`, `/metadata`, `/logs`, and `/compass/probe` exist.
- Docker CI smoke verifies image build plus `/health` and `/run` in sample mode.
- Multi-agent traces show delegation, retry/fallback, critique, validation, escalation, shared context, and deterministic final ownership.
- Output examples are generated from runtime examples and are not loaded as canned responses.
- Product chat validates active clarifying answers before advancing.
- Qdrant and live CrewAI are optional paths, not defaults.

Unsafe claims unless separately verified:

- Official direct Compass is live-verified.
- Qdrant is active.
- Compass embeddings are live-verified.
- Live CrewAI is active.
- Enforced production RBAC is active.
- Enterprise-durable audit persistence is implemented.
- Product gateway, Railway, Vercel, or droplet endpoints are the official Agentathon `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

## 15. Submission Narrative

The concise architecture narrative is:

```text
Parallax42 preserves the existing Node/Vercel product and adds a root FastAPI Agentathon wrapper for reproducible screening. The wrapper exposes the required /run API, runs a multi-agent compliance council, retrieves evidence through local fallback or Qdrant, reads governed learning memory, attempts live Compass advisory in non-sample mode, delegates deterministic execution to the existing Node rules engine, and writes JSONL trace logs. Compass, learning memory, and CrewAI remain advisory; the Deterministic Decision Owner is the final authority and human review remains explicit. The product UI uses a separate server-side gateway for live smart intake and demo workflows, while the evaluator path uses the official OPENAI_* Compass contract.
```
