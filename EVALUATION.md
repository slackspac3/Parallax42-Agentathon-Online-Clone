# Evaluation

## How To Run QA

Run the canonical local QA suite from the repository root:

```bash
npm run qa
```

This runs syntax checks, static page checks, unit tests, local benchmarks, and CrewAI dry-run validation. The product application is a Node/CommonJS Vercel/static app, so there is no React, Vite, Redis, Postgres, or durable queue setup required for this QA path. The separate Agentathon evaluator wrapper is FastAPI/Docker-capable and is validated through the preflight commands below.

## Agentathon Preflight

Run the wrapper submission checks from the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --run-api
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --run-api --npm-qa
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --docker
```

`--run-api` starts `python run.py`, waits for `GET /health`, posts `input_examples/example_1.json` to `/run`, validates structured JSON, and stops the server. `--docker` builds and runs the container only when Docker is installed; if the Docker CLI is missing, it reports `SKIPPED` rather than failing local validation.

CI uses `SAMPLE_MODE=true`, `OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy`, and `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1` so Docker and API shape can be verified without real secrets. Final evaluation should supply a real Compass key through `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Sample mode is fallback/testing only and still executes deterministic logic; it is not a live Compass, Qdrant, CrewAI, or enforced-RBAC claim.

For UI or demo-flow changes, add a human browser check on top of `npm run qa`: verify that the chat is usable, evidence states are visible, the decision room renders a business-first memo, and technical trace details are behind progressive disclosure. The intended validation split is visual, functional, and output quality:

- Visual: no blank first-viewport states, clipped labels, or overlapping right-rail content.
- Functional: chat intake, upload, council run, and export controls still work.
- Output quality: the decision room shows decision, rationale, risks, evidence, agent pairings, human actions, stop conditions, and raw technical details only after expansion.

## Live Local/Hosted Consistency Check

Run this only when `.env.local` contains the same server-side values used by the hosted demo:

```bash
npm run qa:live
```

This starts a local `server.js` instance, verifies local `/api/health` and `/api/admin/status`, checks the local `/api/backend` relay against the DigitalOcean backend, checks the Vercel Compass gateway health route, confirms Qdrant configuration, and sends one real smart-intake request through Compass GPT-5.1. It is intentionally not part of `npm run qa` because it is networked and can spend gateway tokens.

## Unit Tests

Run unit tests only:

```bash
npm test
```

The unit tests cover the Node library and API-adjacent behavior under `tests/unit/`. They are the fastest check when changing `lib/`, API handlers, or export/retrieval behavior.

The decision-room and review-pack tests also assert the governed agent loop: L2 autonomy, agentic pairings, 0-9 quality rubric, separated memory lanes, and human stop conditions. These tests are meant to keep the hackathon story tied to real packaged artifacts rather than only UI copy.

## Benchmarks

Run the benchmark script:

```bash
npm run benchmark
```

The benchmark is a local deterministic evaluation of representative compliance cases. It is intended to prove repeatable behavior, latency envelope, decision readiness, and blocker/control generation for the current engine.

## Qdrant RAG Smoke

Run the Qdrant smoke test only after configuring the server-side Compass gateway and Qdrant variables:

```bash
npm run qdrant:smoke
```

The smoke test indexes a tiny synthetic compliance evidence text, searches it, verifies at least one match, and reports provider, collection, indexed chunk count, and match count. If Qdrant is not configured, it reports a skipped result instead of pretending full RAG is active.

## Governance Reference Index

Seed the sanitized governance-reference corpus after configuring the embedding boundary:

```bash
npm run reference:index
```

This indexes `reference_context/sanitised_enterprise_ai_governance_context.md` as advisory `governance_reference` chunks. It is separate from case evidence and governed learning memory, and search responses return safe snippets/citations only.

## CrewAI Dry-Run Checks

Run the CrewAI validation path:

```bash
npm run check:crewai
```

CrewAI is dry-run/orchestration-shaped by default. These checks validate the scaffolded crew and flow manifests without making CrewAI the source of final compliance decisions. The deterministic compliance engine remains authoritative.

## Golden Demo Evidence

Regenerate judge-facing evidence artifacts:

```bash
npm run capture:evidence
```

The generated snapshots are written under `evidence/`, including readiness, live health, benchmark, golden demo, and sample run artifacts. These files are useful for packaging a submission and showing that the current demo can be replayed.

## Known Limitations

- Compass gateway LLM and embedding calls are optional/advisory and require server-side environment configuration.
- Local vector storage is the default; Qdrant REST is optional only when configured.
- Governed learning memory is advisory precedent storage, not model retraining.
- Live advisory specialists require `AGENT_RUNTIME=crewai_llm`, `CREWAI_ENABLE_LIVE_LLM=1`, and server-side Compass credentials; final decisions remain deterministic.
- Local OCR/document parsing is not implemented in this repository.
- Audit is local append-only hash-chained JSONL, not managed durable storage.
- Production Redis, Postgres, durable queues, and OpenClaw are not implemented or claimed; FastAPI and Docker are limited to the Agentathon evaluator wrapper.
- Human approval remains required; the agent does not auto-approve operational compliance decisions.
