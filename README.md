# Parallax42 Compliance Intelligence Agent

Production-oriented submission workspace for the G42 Compliance Intelligence Agent role.

This repo is the clean build surface for packaging the existing Parallax42 work into a role-aligned agent:

- compliance-domain intake and triage
- evidence-backed obligation mapping
- human-review decision briefs
- traceable control recommendations
- enterprise integration and deployment evidence
- Responsible AI and benchmark artifacts

Hackathon positioning: this submission maps to **Use Case #21: Legal Intelligence / Compliance**. The primary workflow is enterprise agreement and vendor-evidence review: uploaded agreements, DPAs, MSAs, SOC/ISO/BCP evidence, and advisory legal-reference context are converted into a human-review decision pack. The Caselaw Access Project data path is implemented as advisory legal-reference memory, not as legal advice or automated approval.

Agent positioning: the system is intentionally **L2 governed autonomy**. It can loop through intake, evidence retrieval, obligation mapping, risk/control analysis, and review-pack generation, but it stops at missing evidence, low output-rubric score, or accountable human approval. The council is expressed as agentic pairings such as Planner + Doer, Proposer + Critic, Context-Packer + Actor, and Evidence-Weaver + Synthesizer, with deterministic decisioning as the final owner.

Memory is separated into scratchpad state, episodic audit/reviewer logs, and reusable advisory knowledge. Governed learning memory and reference intelligence can improve questions and reviewer suggestions, but they do not train a model or silently change the deterministic decision.

The implementation defaults to deterministic compliance decisions, with CrewAI-shaped dry-run manifests and optional advisory integrations kept behind explicit configuration.

## Judge Quick Start

For the normal cockpit demo:

```bash
npm install
npm run qa
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The local server defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3020`. If the judging environment expects port `3000`, start it with:

```bash
PORT=3000 npm run dev
```

Suggested demo prompt:

```text
Assess whether we can onboard a UAE healthcare analytics vendor using patient data, Microsoft 365, and cross-border cloud processing.
```

Suggested demo steps:

1. Attach a synthetic compliance document from `test-fixtures/compliance-documents/`, for example `02_data_processing_addendum_and_cross_border_terms.pdf`.
2. Run Council.
3. Review the decision memo.
4. Export Executive Review Pack PDF.

## Agentathon Evaluation

Selected use case: **21 Legal Intelligence**.

The existing product runtime is still the Node/CommonJS app under `server.js`, `api/`, `lib/`, and `public/`. For Agentathon screening, the repo root also includes a Python FastAPI wrapper that starts on `0.0.0.0:8000`, exposes `GET /health`, `GET /metadata`, `GET /logs`, `GET /compass/probe`, and `POST /run`, then delegates deterministic execution to `scripts/agentathon_run.js`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
python run.py
```

Call the evaluator path:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @input_examples/example_1.json
```

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t parallax42-agentathon .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SAMPLE_MODE=true \
  -e OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy \
  parallax42-agentathon
```

Compass/OpenAI-compatible variables are placeholders in `.env.example`:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=replace-with-your-compass-api-key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1
MODEL_FAST=gpt-4.1
MODEL_REASONING=gpt-5.1
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
```

No secrets are committed. `SAMPLE_MODE=true` is accepted for evaluator compatibility, but it does not switch to canned outputs; the wrapper still runs the deterministic Node rules engine. Live Compass, Qdrant, enforced RBAC, and live CrewAI are optional/configurable paths and are not claimed active unless those environment variables are set and separately verified.

Known limitations: the Agentathon path returns structured JSON and trace logs, not the browser cockpit; the decision is a human-review compliance package, not legal advice or automatic approval; Qdrant and live advisory specialists are disabled by default.

## Agentathon Preflight

Run the local submission checks:

```bash
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --run-api
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --run-api --npm-qa
python scripts/agentathon_preflight.py --docker
```

The Docker check requires a machine with Docker installed. Some local Codex environments do not include the Docker CLI; in that case `--docker` reports `SKIPPED` with the reason rather than failing the whole preflight.

`SAMPLE_MODE=true` is a fallback/testing flag only. It must not be presented as live Compass execution, and it still runs the simplified deterministic Node rules path rather than returning canned output files. Final evaluation should provide:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=<real Compass key>
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://compass.core42.ai/v1
```

## What This Demo Does Not Claim

- The product runtime is not rewritten as Python; FastAPI is only the Agentathon evaluation wrapper.
- This repository does not include Redis, Postgres, Celery, or durable queues.
- Without the optional remote Python CrewAI service, the runtime degrades to deterministic decisioning plus CrewAI-shaped dry run.
- Live LLM specialist output is optional and advisory.
- Qdrant support exists only when configured; local-file vector storage is the demo default.
- OCR/parser capability is integrated through external relay paths rather than implemented as a local parser service in this repo.
- OpenClaw is not implemented and should not be claimed.

## Current Status

Implemented in this repo:

- `POST /api/conversation` NLP case-builder endpoint that asks follow-up questions and executes the agent workflow when ready
- `POST /api/agent/run` CrewAI Flow-routed compliance-agent run with deterministic fallback
- `POST /api/evidence/index` and `POST /api/evidence/search` server-side retrieval boundary: gateway embeddings and indexed chunks stay behind the API; the browser receives case/evidence/index metadata plus safe snippets/citations needed for the reviewer UI
- `GET /api/readiness` submission-readiness inventory
- `GET /api/health` runtime and linked-platform status
- Vercel-compatible serverless API functions under `api/`
- allowlisted browser relay for an optional configured Parallax42 backend at `GET/POST /api/backend`
- GitHub Pages static cockpit with chat-first agent mode and advanced runtime controls
- browser cockpit for conversational case building, agent execution, evidence, gaps, and trace events
- CrewAI Flow adapter plus six role-specific agents and YAML task definitions
- local benchmark endpoint and audit JSONL persistence
- generated evidence capture under `evidence/`
- replayable golden demo workflow at `GET /api/demo/golden`
- unit tests and syntax checks
- initial G42 submission dossier under `docs/`

Optional prior-demo endpoints, not required for Agentathon evaluation:

- Parallax42 demo UI: `https://slackspac3.github.io/Parallax42/`
- External Parallax42 backend health: `https://api.parallax42.bhavukarora.com/health`
- Compass gateway: `https://parallax42-compass-gateway.vercel.app/api/health`
- Compliance Intelligence Agent API: `https://parallax42-compliance-intelligence.vercel.app`

## Run Locally

For local testing that matches the hosted demo boundary, create `.env.local` from the relevant values in `.env.example`. `npm run dev` automatically loads `.env` and `.env.local`; shell-exported variables still win. Keep secrets such as `COMPASS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, and `P42_CREWAI_SERVICE_TOKEN` out of git.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3020
```

## Test

```bash
npm run qa
```

Run the live dependency check only after configuring private live-service credentials and when you intentionally want to verify external backend, gateway, Qdrant, and Compass access:

```bash
npm run qa:live
```

`npm run qa` stays deterministic and does not spend gateway tokens. `npm run qa:live` is intentionally networked and requires `.env.local` to contain the same server-side values used by Vercel.

## Evidence Capture

Capture health snapshots, benchmark output, readiness inventory, and a sample agent trace:

```bash
npm run capture:evidence
```

The generated files land in `evidence/` and are safe to include in a submission pack because secrets and raw uploads are not stored there.

## Request Size Boundaries

Evidence files can be up to 30 MB per file in the browser cockpit. Large files are not sent as raw JSON: they are hashed client-side, split into 1 MB parser-relay chunks, parsed/OCRed behind the backend boundary, and then represented in chat as sanitized metadata and snippets.

Parsed evidence index requests have a separate JSON limit of 15 MB by default. Conversation, standard run, agent run, and review-pack JSON requests default to 8 MB. These limits support complex case metadata while keeping raw document content on the chunked upload path.

The JSON limits can be overridden with `CONVERSATION_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, `EVIDENCE_INDEX_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, `EVIDENCE_SEARCH_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, `REVIEW_PACK_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, `STANDARD_RUN_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`, and `ADMIN_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`.

## Deployment Surfaces

- Static cockpit: `public/`, deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- Serverless API: `api/`, deployable to Vercel.
- Live backend proof: proxied through the allowlisted `/api/backend` relay.

Advanced components can be switched on through environment variables or `GET|PATCH /api/admin/features` when the required backing service is configured. Smart chat intake requires `COMPASS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`; when it is absent or the gateway fails, the chat reports that smart intake is unavailable instead of silently pretending a live LLM result exists. The admin response distinguishes `enabled`, `configured`, and `active`, so missing Compass tokens, Qdrant URLs, parser relay configuration, or optional CrewAI Python dependencies are visible.

Full RAG and governed-learning demo setup:

```text
COMPASS_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=https://parallax42-compass-gateway.vercel.app/api
COMPASS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<server-side gateway token>
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
P42_VECTOR_STORE_PROVIDER=qdrant

P42_CREWAI_SERVICE_TOKEN=<server-side-service-token>
P42_AUTH_MODE=audit
```

Qdrant is required for the full RAG and governed learning memory demo. The local-file vector store remains a demo fallback only. The remote Python CrewAI service is required for live CrewAI execution from Vercel because Vercel's Node runtime does not install the Python CrewAI adapter. Governed learning stores auditable reviewer memory and precedent patterns; it is not model retraining and never silently changes the deterministic council decision. Live LLM specialists are advisory only, and human approval remains required.

After configuring Qdrant and the Compass gateway, run:

```bash
npm run qdrant:smoke
npm run reference:index
npm run reference:intelligence
npm run reference:courtlistener
```

`npm run reference:index` seeds `reference_context/sanitised_enterprise_ai_governance_context.md` as sanitized governance-reference memory. It is advisory context only: it helps chat and retrieval reason about governance, assurance, SAA, ISO, Responsible AI, and risk language, but it is not official policy and never overrides the deterministic council or human review boundary.

`npm run reference:intelligence` creates safe local reference-lane artifacts without live API calls. It covers legal, compliance, procurement, security, AI governance, sanctions/export, and HSE/ESG lane directories so the demo can explain the broader ingestion strategy without pretending those corpora are already fully loaded.

`npm run reference:courtlistener` aligns the demo with Use Case #21's legal/compliance reference path through CourtListener / Free Law Project. It imports a small CourtListener sample when `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` is configured or local JSON/JSONL is supplied, writes normalized legal-reference records under `reference_context/legal/`, and can index the resulting markdown through the same reference-memory path. CourtListener references are advisory legal intelligence only; they are not jurisdiction-specific advice and cannot approve a contract. The legacy `npm run reference:cap` command remains available for CAP API access.

See [`docs/REFERENCE_INTELLIGENCE_DATA.md`](docs/REFERENCE_INTELLIGENCE_DATA.md) for the broader legal, compliance, procurement, security, AI governance, sanctions/export, and HSE/ESG reference-lane model.

## CrewAI

Validate the CrewAI crew design without installing optional dependencies:

```bash
npm run check:crewai
```

Dry-run validation covers both CrewAI Crew and CrewAI Flow manifests. Install optional dependencies for live CrewAI validation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-crewai.txt
python crewai_adapter/compliance_flow.py --live-flow --input examples/high_risk_ai_saas_case.json
python crewai_adapter/compliance_crew.py --live-crewai --input examples/high_risk_ai_saas_case.json
```

Enable live LLM calls only with approved credentials:

```bash
export CREWAI_ENABLE_LIVE_LLM=1
export CREWAI_LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.1
export CREWAI_LLM_BASE_URL=https://parallax42-compass-gateway.vercel.app/api
export CREWAI_LLM_API_KEY=$COMPASS_GATEWAY_TOKEN
AGENT_RUNTIME=crewai_llm npm run dev
```

Live LLM specialist output is attached under `orchestration.llmOutput`; on Vercel this can use the Node-side Compass advisory adapter when `AGENT_RUNTIME=crewai_llm` and `CREWAI_ENABLE_LIVE_LLM=1` are set. The final decision remains guarded by the deterministic engine. The evidence boundary uses server-side `POST /api/evidence/index` and `POST /api/evidence/search`, calls the reusable Parallax42 embedding boundary using `text-embedding-3-large`, stores chunk vectors behind the API, and keeps embedding vectors out of browser state. The browser may carry sanitized document metadata, excerpts, and retrieved snippets so the chat and reviewer UI can explain what was used.

For live CrewAI multi-agent execution from Vercel, configure `P42_CREWAI_SERVICE_URL` and `P42_CREWAI_SERVICE_TOKEN`. The Node runtime delegates the six-agent CrewAI council to that service, attaches its output under `orchestration.crewaiOutput`, then still applies the deterministic council as the final decision owner.

Learning memory endpoints are advisory:

- `POST /api/learning/feedback` records reviewer feedback, outcomes, controls, rejected evidence, and missing evidence as auditable learning artifacts.
- `POST /api/learning/similar-cases` returns similar prior cases.
- `GET|POST /api/learning/control-suggestions` returns common reviewer-added controls and repeated missing evidence patterns.

`POST /api/export/review-pack` creates the server-side executive review pack with digest, evidence quality, retrieval audit, citation manifest, reviewer actions, and a PDF payload. The cockpit uses this endpoint for the Exec review pack button and falls back to a local HTML report only if the API is unavailable.

## Build Direction

The next implementation milestone is evidence intake and citation discipline:

1. add document/evidence upload or relay-backed evidence intake
2. add evidence chunk IDs and citation-required output
3. make uploaded DPA/model-training/continuity evidence clear specific blockers
4. preserve redaction and audit trace boundaries
5. add citation precision and missing-evidence evals
