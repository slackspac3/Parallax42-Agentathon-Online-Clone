# Parallax42 Compliance Intelligence Agent

Production-oriented submission workspace for the G42 Compliance Intelligence Agent role.

This repo is the clean build surface for packaging the existing Parallax42 work into a role-aligned agent:

- compliance-domain intake and triage
- evidence-backed obligation mapping
- human-review decision briefs
- traceable control recommendations
- enterprise integration and deployment evidence
- Responsible AI and benchmark artifacts

The implementation starts with a dependency-light local agent runtime so the repo is runnable immediately. The stronger Parallax42 assets remain the source of truth for the live supplier-risk backend and are referenced in the submission dossier.

## Current Status

Implemented in this repo:

- `POST /api/agent/run` deterministic compliance-agent run
- `GET /api/readiness` submission-readiness inventory
- `GET /api/health` runtime and linked-platform status
- Vercel-compatible serverless API functions under `api/`
- allowlisted browser relay to the live Parallax42 backend at `GET/POST /api/backend`
- GitHub Pages static cockpit with runtime mode controls
- browser cockpit for running the agent and reviewing evidence, gaps, and trace events
- optional CrewAI adapter with six role-specific agents and YAML task definitions
- local benchmark endpoint and audit JSONL persistence
- generated evidence capture under `evidence/`
- unit tests and syntax checks
- initial G42 submission dossier under `docs/`

Linked live assets already in place:

- Parallax42 demo UI: `https://slackspac3.github.io/Parallax42/`
- Parallax42 FastAPI backend: `https://api.parallax42.bhavukarora.com/health`
- Compass gateway: `https://parallax42-compass-gateway.vercel.app/api/health`
- Compliance Intelligence Agent API: `https://parallax42-compliance-intelligence.vercel.app`

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3020
```

## Test

```bash
npm run qa
```

## Evidence Capture

Capture live health snapshots, benchmark output, readiness inventory, and a sample agent trace:

```bash
npm run capture:evidence
```

The generated files land in `evidence/` and are safe to include in a submission pack because secrets and raw uploads are not stored there.

## Deployment Surfaces

- Static cockpit: `public/`, deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- Serverless API: `api/`, deployable to Vercel.
- Live backend proof: proxied through the allowlisted `/api/backend` relay.

Key environment variables:

```

## CrewAI

Validate the CrewAI crew design without installing optional dependencies:

```bash
npm run check:crewai
```

Install and run the optional live CrewAI adapter:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-crewai.txt
python crewai_adapter/compliance_crew.py --live-crewai --input examples/high_risk_ai_saas_case.json
```

## Build Direction

The next implementation milestone is to replace the deterministic local evidence layer with a packaged extraction from Parallax42 and promote the Vercel API deployment:

1. connect `/api/agent/run` to the live Parallax42 workflow behind an approval-gated switch
2. move audit events from JSONL to PostgreSQL or another immutable append store
3. add Entra-ready JWT validation and role-policy middleware
4. expand benchmark coverage to upload/OCR, adversarial, latency, and fallback cases
5. record the "Watch the Agent Work" demo path
